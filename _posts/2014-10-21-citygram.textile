I was recently introduced to Dr. Tae Hong Park, an Associate Professor, Composition & Music Technology at NYU.  

Dr.Park is leading the Citygram project which _aims to deliver a real-time visualization/mapping system focusing on non-ocular energies through scale-accurate, non-intrusive, and data-driven interactive digital maps_.

The [real-time heatmap](http://citygram.smusic.nyu.edu/viz/) overlay for google maps is fantastic!  I'm exicted to explore the possibilities of collaborating with Dr. Park and the Citygram project team.
