        <p class="c1"><span class="c0 c6">by Luke Van Horn for The GovLab / City Sound Map Project </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0 c8"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In a 2001 US Census survey, 11.8 million households said street or traffic noise was bothersome. An additional 4.5 million residents said it was so bad they wanted to move. &nbsp;A number of more recent independent studies puts that number even higher. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Most people would agree that it&#39;s getting louder all the time. &nbsp;Noise pollution seems to have increased in both urban, rural and even wilderness areas. &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">However, these surveys are subjective and the more recent studies we have are very limited in scope. &nbsp;We need to prove the problem exists on a larger scale by collecting accurate sound data from locations around the country. &nbsp;We must discover when and where it occurs. &nbsp;This information will be key to developing new noise abatement strategies and gauging their effectiveness. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
        <h2 class="c2"><a name="h.nw8dlctk6n1j"></a><span>The (missing) Data</span></h2>
        <p class="c3 c5 c4"><span class="c8 c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Office of Noise Abatement and Control (ONAC). &nbsp; The job of ONAC was to study noise pollution, devise noise abatement strategies, and work with state and local governments to setup policy to enforce the Noise Control Act and later the Quiet Communities Act. &nbsp;Our most comprehensive data comes from research coordinated under ONAC. &nbsp;Unfortunately, congress defunded the agency in 1981 under the Reagan administration and very little large scale research has been carried out in the 33 years since. &nbsp; Without support from the EPA, &nbsp;the state and local noise abatement programs have declined significantly. &nbsp;Multiple attempts to reinstate funding for ONAC have failed to make it through Congress.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">While U.S. research has stalled out, The European Union has been creating detailed 3-D maps of noise levels. &nbsp;Newsweek reported in 2004 that observations from this data where able to show one loud motorcycle traveling through Paris in the middle of the night having the potential to impact the sleep of 200,000 people.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Since the closure of ONAC, our information about the scale and distribution of noise pollution in the U.S. is outdated. &nbsp;We need to resume collecting noise data on a national scale, using this information to build noise maps and resume abatement programs.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <h2 class="c2"><a name="h.qtgqguz71z41"></a><span>Health Effects </span></h2>
        <p class="c3 c5 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The National Institute of Health (NIH) has carried out a number of studies on the adverse health effects from exposure to chronic noise pollution. &nbsp;These include elevated blood pressure, loss of sleep, increased heart rate, cardiovascular constriction, labored breathing, and changes in brain chemistry. &nbsp;In 1981, the EPA estimated that nearly 100 million people in the United States (about 50% of the population) had annual exposures to traffic noise that were high enough to be harmful to health. &nbsp;This impacts people of every age, race and gender. &nbsp;Children exhibit decreased performance in school and behavioral problems. &nbsp;Many people are unaware of the subtle, yet harmful changes in physiology; &nbsp;while they may subjectively habituate to a noisy environment, their body does not. &nbsp;Sleep disturbances activate the sympathetic nervous system and pull us from a deep sleep into lighter states, contributing to sleep deprivation.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Having an accurate noise map of our cities and towns will help us understand who is at risk of suffering these adverse effects. &nbsp;Citizens will be able to make informed decisions about where they choose to live. &nbsp;A child&rsquo;s school may be in a quiet zone, but what about their home? &nbsp;</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <h2 class="c2"><a name="h.ikn4kiw43icd"></a><span>Beyond Humans </span></h2>
        <p class="c3 c4 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">There is also evidence that vehicle noise is having a negative impact on wildlife. &nbsp;The National Park Service has been monitoring sound levels and studying this impact at 70 national parks around the country. &nbsp;The noise from a single motorcycle has been shown to travel 18 miles into wilderness areas. Analysis of sound and wildlife data, along with direct observation, indicates a sometimes significant impact on communication and reproduction of many birds and mammals. &nbsp;Behavioral and physiological responses have the potential to cause injury, energy loss (from movement away from noise source), decrease in food intake, habitat avoidance and abandonment, and reproductive losses. &nbsp; </span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The data being collected by the National Park Service is step in the right direction, but it is limited to a small number of roads inside national parks. &nbsp;There are 100 million acres of wilderness area in the United States. &nbsp;A wider range of data is important to understand the noise impacts of recreational vehicles, mining operations, and other human activities allowed on public lands.</span></p>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p>
        <h2 class="c2"><a name="h.cp4mofu7cmrv"></a><span>Conclusions </span></h2>
        <p class="c3 c4"><span></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">The first step in solving our noise problem is proving there is a noise problem. &nbsp; To prove it, we need to begin collecting accurate sound data. &nbsp; With this data we can identify the sources of noise, which sources have the greatest impact, and develop noise abatement strategies. Sound maps will help inform citizens about their environment and associated health risks. &nbsp;Combined with other habitat data, we will better understand the high risk areas for sensitive wildlife. &nbsp; </span></p>
